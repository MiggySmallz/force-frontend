          Hi there! Thanks for using Effect Network. It's important to read the
          following information before using the platform.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This is a mainnet-<b>beta</b> release. We're still working on ironing
          out the kinks and adding missing features. The smart contracts that
          are being used have <b>not yet been audited</b> and you are using them
          on your own risk.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          When completing tasks or depositing EFX the tokens are stored in your
          Effect vaccount contract. You should <b>only store small amounts of
            funds</b> here. Frequently withdraw your contract balance to a safe
          account.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          The most convenient way to login is with a BSC private key. This key
          is only stored locally in the browser. Always <b>keep a backup</b> of
          your key and only use it to store small amounts of funds.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          We're working hard to make Effect a safe and friendly environment to
          work in the crypto
          space. <a href="https://discord.gg/effectnetwork" target="_blank">Join our
            Discord</a> and let us know what you think!
